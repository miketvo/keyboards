Ký Âm Tự〈記音t字〉- also called Chữ Ký Âm〈𡦂記音〉is a part of the Tam Thư〈三書〉writing system - a constructed writing system for Vietnamese. It's a three-way mix of traditional [Hán Nôm](http://www.nomfoundation.org)〈漢喃〉ideograms and a constructed phonetic alphabet/abugida - Ký Âm Tự〈記音字〉- inspired by Japanese hiragana, Manchurian/Mongolian script, and Sanskrit-derived scripts from South East Asia (Thai, Lao, Cambodian,...), in combination with the contemporary Latin based Vietnamese writing system (chữ Latin Quốc Ngữ).
