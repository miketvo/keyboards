<h1>Keyman Vietnamese Ky Am</h1>

<p>
  Ký Âm Tự〈記音t字〉- also called Chữ Ký Âm〈𡦂記音〉is a part of the Tam Thư〈三書〉writing system.
</p>

<p>
  Tam Thư〈三書〉- full name Latin 國語・漢喃・記音字〈Latin Quốc Ngữ - Hán Nôm - Ký Âm Tự〉- is a constructed writing system for Vietnamese
</p>

<p>
  It's a three-way mix of traditional <a href="http://www.nomfoundation.org">Hán Nôm</a>〈漢喃〉ideograms and a constructed phonetic alphabet/abugida - Ký Âm Tự〈記音字〉- inspired by Japanese hiragana, Manchurian/Mongolian script, and Sanskrit-derived scripts from South East Asia (Thai, Lao, Cambodian,...), in combination with the contemporary Latin based Vietnamese writing system (chữ Latin Quốc Ngữ).</p>

<p>In short, the way this system works is as follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sentence capitalization and proper noun capitalization: Use historical Hán Nôm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character">Ruby text</a> in either Ký Âm Tự or Latin Quốc Ngữ may be provided for phonetic aid depending on how uncommon the word/reading is (an ideogram can have multiple different phonetic readings depending on context, usually with related meanings).</li>
  <li>Lowercase native Vietnamese and Sino-Vietnamese words: Use constructed Ký Âm Tự.</li>
  <li>Loanwords of Western/other origins and words adopted from Vietnamese ethnic minorities: Use existing Latin Quốc Ngữ.</li>
  <li>Use existing Vietnamese capitalization rules (essentially English capitalization rules with a few edge cases of Vietnamese-specific additions).</li>
  <li>Use existing Indo-Arabic numerals (0-9).</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_Symbols_and_Punctuation">CJK punctuation</a>.</li>
  <li>Spacing and indentation in vertical mode: Follow <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/和字間隔">Japanese spacing guidelines</a>.</li>
  <li>Spacing and indentation in horizontal mode: Follow existing regular conventions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>
  This is a thought experiment of "what if" Vietnamese had developed its own writing system based on Han characters and updated it for modern use, like Korean Hangul or Japanese Hiragana/Katakana + Kanji. Its goal is to preserve and promote all Vietnamese writing systems of the past and current, have them work together, while being aesthetically pleasing, functionally up to date and fit for modern use.
