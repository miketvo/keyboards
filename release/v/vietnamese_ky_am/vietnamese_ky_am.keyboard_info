It's a three-way mix of traditional Hán Nôm〈漢喃〉ideograms and a constructed phonetic alphabet/abugida - Ký Âm Tự〈記音字〉- inspired by Japanese hiragana, Manchurian/Mongolian script, and Sanskrit-derived scripts from South East Asia (Thai, Lao, Cambodian,...), in combination with the contemporary Latin based Vietnamese writing system (chữ Latin Quốc Ngữ)."
